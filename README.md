# Q & A

<b>Q:</b> Where can I find the Settings menu?<br>
<b>A:</b> The Settings icon is revealed when hovering over the profile picture. Clicking it will launch the Settings menu.

<b>Q:</b> Where can I change the default Shortcuts?<br>
<b>A:</b> From Settings! Just navigate to the Shortcuts menu and select the icon you can to adjust from the bottom menu. Then, you can either apply one of the already made ones or create a custom one with your image file as icon and file to be opened when the Shortcut is clicked. Launching websites and other special Windows commands is coming in a future release, stay tuned.

<b>Q:</b> How to disable rotating wallpapers?<br>
<b>A:</b> You can disable rotating wallpapers by unloading the Wallpapers.ini skin. To do that, open Rainmeter and from the left menu navigate to Clockworld/Wallpapers. Select the Wallpapers.ini file and then "Unload" from the main options of the program on the right. You should know that when disabling rotating wallpapers, colors and rotating quotes will also get disabled.

<b>Q:</b> What about animations? (Birds flying, trees moving etc.)<br>
<b>A:</b> Rendering animations requires extra material working in the background every second. It is normal that this, would consume an enormous amount of computer resources only by playing the animation. We will try to make it work in the future.

<b>Q:</b> How can I change the default music player?<br>
<b>A:</b> If the player is displaying a track: Just hover over the Visualizer and click the "<" button on the left to open the Music Players menu and select your desired one. The skin will save your selection until you change it again.<br>
If the player is closed: Click the current player icon and select your desired one.
